				    DayZ Spawn Editor by: Spartan1034x

				        **Features and Limitations**
This spawn editor was created to expidite the creation of .json for spawnGearPresetFiles. There is currently 
minimal validation for equipment restrictions. So yes if you put a 75 round drum mag on your Tundra, your file
will not work. 

					   **How You Can Help**
There is still lots of testing to be done, if anybody would like to help contributions are welcome! You can fork 
my repo and submit changes as you see fit, or message me on discord @spartan1034x, or by email spartan1034x@gmail.com.
