				    DayZ Spawn Editor by: Spartan1034x

				        **Features and Limitations**
This spawn editor was created to expidite the creation of .json for spawnGearPresetFiles. There is currently 
minimal validation for equipment restrictions. So yes if you put a 75 round drum mag on your Tundra, your file
will not work. 

					   **How You Can Help**

my repo and submit changes as you see fit, or message me on discord @spartan1034x, or by email spartan1034x@gmail.com.
